# Epileptic_Seizure_Classification

Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting about 1.2% (3.4 million people) in the US, and more than 65 million globally. Additionally, about 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy at some point during their lifetime. There are many kinds of seizures, each with different symptoms, such as losing consciousness, jerking movements, or confusion. Some seizures are much harder to detect visually; the patients will usually exhibit symptoms such as not responding or staring blankly for a brief period. Seizures can happen unexpectedly and can result in injuries such as falling, biting of the tongue, or losing control of oneâ€™s urine or stool. Hence, these are some of the reasons why seizure detection is of utmost importance for patients under medical supervision that are suspected to be seizure prone. This project will use binary classification methods to predict whether an individual is having a seizure or not.
